# Vy Bespoke
You are the best symbol of your brand. We make glasses to reflect who you are.

The glasses you wear convey an impression of who you are. If you work with us, you will create something in your image. Our design process can begin from the impression you want to make, a reference, a story, a desire, or even from your name. 

Our aim is to truly understand what makes **you** important and reflect that in or design.
