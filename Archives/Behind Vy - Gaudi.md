# Behind Vy - Gaudi
July 8. 2024

Vy is a shared vision; it's the product of the collective of myself and my cofounder Alec. There are 3 important themes about how I see the brand that I want you to know as you interact with our products.

**1. Collective**
The collective means that everyone works together but is their own individual. It's just Alec and I now but we plan for everyone at Vy to have real creative responsibility. We share resources and a mission but we don't all blend into one identity. That's what makes Vy unique - it's a collective of individuals. 

**2. Open**
I build in the open. I don't like to be stuck on problems that are already solved or use a worse version of something that already exists. I'll soon share my thoughts on our technology, setup, marketing, and designs here and on Youtube. I encourage anyone who can to make use of the information we put out and add to it. I'm confident that the intention we put out in our work will return to us tenfold in the most awesome way possible.

**3. Vision**
I and the people I work with have an incredibly ambitious vision. I want the people who wear Vy to be of that same cloth. Vy is for business and brand owners - people that create. I want you to be the best ambassadors of your own brands that you can be. Because I know your vision will change the world for the better.

We are going to do it all at Vy. Alec and I have talked about crazy dreams and aspirations for developing our tech and services. Things that will elevate Vy to unicorn and beyond status. We will work hard until that time comes.
